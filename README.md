# Python Design Patterns

## Description
* This repository contains an overview of the Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns as outlined in their seminal book, together with modern-day variations, adjustments, discussions of intrinsic use of patterns in Python.

## Learning Objectives
* SOLID Design Principles:
  * [Single Responsibility Principle](/solid/single_responsibility.py)
  * [Open-Closed Principle](/solid/open_closed.py)
  * [Liskov Substitution Principle](/solid/liskov.py)
  * [Interface Segregation Principle](/solid/interface_segregation.py)
  * [Dependency Inversion Principle](/solid/dependency_inversion.py)
* Creational Design Patterns:
  * [Builder](/builder)
    * A builder is a separate component for building an object
    * Can either give builder an initializer or return it via a static function
    * To make builder fluent, return self
    * Different facets of an object can be built with different builders working in tandem via a base class
  * [Factories (Factory Method and Abstract Factory)](/factories)
    * A factory method is a static method that creates object
    * A factory is an entity that can take care of object creation
    * A factory can be external or reside inside the object as an inner class
    * Hierarchies of factories can be used to create related objects
  * Prototype
  * Singleton
* Structrural Design Patterns:
  * Adapter
  * Bridge
  * Composite
  * Decorator
  * Fa√ßade
  * Flyweight
  * Proxy
* Behavioral Design Patterns
  * Chain of Responsibility
  * Command
  * Interpreter
  * Iterator
  * Mediator
  * Memento
  * Observer
  * State
  * Strategy
  * Template
  * Method
  * Visitor

## Usage
